DEFINITION: Variables are containers created inside the computer's memory to store useful information for the program.
For example, if a program needs to receive input from the user it'll have to keep track of that data. Programmers are able to do that 
through the use of variables.

=====

To create a variable in Python we use the "=" operator. This operator indicates that a container to store data is being created.

CODE:
    x = 1

In the line of code above we created a container called "x" which will carry the numerical value 1.

Here are a few examples:
    CODE:
        y = 3.14
        z = "Davi"
        w = True

For every container created("y", "z", "w") in the lines of code above, they will carry particular data(3.14, Davi, True).
Each of these data have their own data types, which we'll learn in another note. But the point is: variables(containers)
carry data inside.
