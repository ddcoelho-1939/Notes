DEFINITION: Every data inside a computer program has a type. The type exists to define expected behaviour for each data and to give structure to the program.
For example, if we have numerical data inside a computer program, we can't perform operations related to text data. The same way, if we have 
text data, we can't perform operations related to numerical data. This is all defined through the data types of each data.
